**Description:**

PyCalc is a straightforward Python program designed to perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers. It provides users with a simple interface to input numbers and choose from addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. The program ensures accurate calculations and handles common errors such as invalid inputs or division by zero gracefully.

**Key Features:**
- User-friendly interface for entering numbers and selecting operations.
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Robust error handling to prevent crashes from invalid inputs.
- Provides clear and immediate feedback with calculation results.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Python:** Programming language used to implement the calculator logic.
- **Basic Input/Output:** Utilizes Python's standard input and output functions.
- **Conditional Statements:** Controls flow based on user-selected operations.
- **Exception Handling:** Ensures smooth execution by catching and managing errors.

**Objective:**

The primary goal of PyCalc is to offer a simple yet functional calculator experience in Python, suitable for learning basic programming concepts like user input handling, conditional logic, and error management.

**Future Enhancements:**
- Incorporate more advanced mathematical functions.
- Enhance the user interface with graphical elements.
- Support for handling fractions or decimals.
  
**Conclusion:**

PyCalc serves as an ideal starting project for beginners looking to practice Python programming fundamentals while building a useful utility application. It emphasizes simplicity, reliability, and practicality in its design and implementation.
